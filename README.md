## 📝 Todo App
A simple and modern Todo application built with React, TypeScript, Redux, and IndexedDB.
This project focuses on state management and persistent storage without a backend, making it a great example of how to handle authentication and data locally in the browser.

## ✨ Technologies
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux
- IndexedDB
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 Signup/Login with password hashing
- 💾 Persistent storage using IndexedDB (no server required)
- ✅ Add, toggle, and delete todos
- 🔄 State management via classic Redux (no toolkit)
- 🎨 Clean UI with responsive design

## 📍 The Process
I wanted to build a Todo app to learn and sharpen my skills with Redux, and IndexedDB. Instead of relying on a backend, I wanted everything to live directly in the browser.

I started simple with authentication signup and login pages styled cleanly. From there, I added Redux for state management, and hooked it up with IndexedDB so tasks and user sessions persist even after a refresh, especially making sure data stayed consistent between Redux and the database.

The goal wasn’t to reinvent the wheel, but to create a project that feels solid, responsive, and a little closer to how a real-world app works—only without a server. Along the way, I learned a ton about handling async state, working with IndexedDB directly, and structuring reducers/actions in plain Redux.
